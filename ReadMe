### Key Features

* **Real-time Vulnerability Scanning:** Identifies common weaknesses in network configurations, such as weak encryption protocols or default credentials.
* **Signal Integrity Check:** Detects jamming, spoofing attempts, and hidden devices that could indicate malicious activity.
* **Device Enumeration:** Discovers and lists devices already connected to the network, providing insights into potential exposure.
* **Security Score & Report:** Generates a comprehensive security grade and detailed report, highlighting risks and offering recommendations.
* **Cross-Platform:** Built with portability in mind, Aegis Wireless is designed to run on various operating systems including macOS and Linux.

### How it Works (Under the Hood)

Aegis Wireless leverages a combination of active and passive scanning techniques:

1.  **Passive Reconnaissance:** Listens for broadcasted network information without sending any packets, gathering details like SSIDs, BSSIDs, channels, and encryption types.
2.  **Active Probing (Configurable):** For deeper analysis, it can optionally send crafted packets to test for known vulnerabilities, such as WPA2 handshake weaknesses or open ports on connected devices.
3.  **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Compares identified network characteristics against a database of known threats and vulnerabilities to provide an accurate risk assessment.
